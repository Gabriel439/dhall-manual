# The Dhall Configuration Language Manual

This is a work-in-progress book about the Dhall configuration language that I
will publish on Leanpub

The book will serve as a "How to" guide, targeting people already familiar with
the basics of the language and interested in worked examples for non-trivial
tasks.

## Contributing

Feedback is welcome (via issues), but you will probably want to hold off on
making pull requests until this book is close to completion.  I reserve the
right to make major changes, so don't contribute prose unless you're okay with
me deleting or substantially rewriting your contribution without notice.

Right now you should treat this mostly as a private project of mine that just
happens to be done in a public repository for people interested in its progress.
