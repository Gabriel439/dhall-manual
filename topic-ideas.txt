* Upcoming chapters
    * IDE support (motivated by effectively navigating the newly-granular
      project layout)
    * Prelude (motivated by using `Prelude.List.generate` to simplify
      auto-generating backport-related rules)

* For application authors
    * Running example: integrating Dhall into an example twelve-factor app
    * How to install the tooling
        * How to obtain various `dhall*` executables
    * Generally useful tricks (?)
    * Is Dhall appropriate for a given project or use case?
    * Instructions on how to configure a new project using Dhall
        * Language bindings
        * `dhall-to-{json,yaml,text,bash}`
    * How to edit Dhall code with IDE support?
    * How to check a Dhall configuration file against a schema
      (i.e. type annotation)
    * How to migrate a Dhall configuration file (i.e. function)
    * How to integrate Dhall with CI (i.e. formatting/linting/caching)
        * ... including how to save the cache between CI runs?
    * How to use/obtain/"install" a remote expression/package
        * Semantic integrity checks
        * If not using semantic integrity checks, discuss how Dhall fits in with
          filesystem hierarchy standard
    * How to secure a Dhall project
        * e.g. threat model
    * How to use and navigate the Prelude
    * How to organize a project (as an application author)
    * How to share a Dhall configuration file across multiple languages and file
      formats
    * Common idioms (e.g. `import sha256:â€¦ ? import`)
    * How to detect changes in a package across releases (i.e. `dhall diff`)
    * How to depend directly on a binary artifact (i.e. the cache) instead of
      source
    * How to debug more effectively (especially type errors)
    * How to integrate with services (i.e. parametrizing configuration on a
      service call or multiplexing data)
    * Translating traditional terms (e.g. "schema"/"template") into Dhall
      terminology (i.e. "type"/"function")
    * Keeping generated files in sync with Dhall files if checked into version
      control
* For package authors
    * Running example: Packing Dhall bindings to Mergify configuration
    * How to create a systematic binding to widely used configuration
    * Naming conventions
    * Recommended extension = `.dhall`
    * How to deal with weakly-typed JSON idioms
    * How to organize a package (i.e. the API)
    * How to organize a project (as a package author)
    * How to make invalid types unrepresentable
    * How to "version" a project
    * How to build in forwards compatibility
    * Idioms for documenting functions and presenting them (i.e. `let` idiom
      used by Prelude to give the function a name and type)
    * How to cope with an evolving language standard
    * How to host a package for others to use
    * How to make a package discoverable
    * How to tastefully author an API
    * How to write tests
